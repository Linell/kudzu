        Kudzu is, at the core, an RSS feed aggregator that helps you stay informed without accidentally ending up in an 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)" target="_blank">echo chamber.</a> It accomplishes
        that by exposing you to news sources that you may not usually visit. For example, if you typically spend all day
        on Reddit's <a href="https://reddit.com/r/politics" target="_blank">/r/politics</a> then you probably don't see
        many articles from Fox News. Conversly, if you typically only listen to Rush Limbaugh there's a solid chance
        that a headline from Mother Jones isn't going to cross your path very often. What if none of the headlines you see
        include a piece of information that changes your opinion?

        Right now Kudzu is under active development and is only pulling from CNN and Fox News for the headlines displayed.
        The plan is to drastically increase the number of sources in the future, though, and use the concepts of tags to help
        filter back down to the topics that you as a user actually care about. After signing up for an account, any user can
        tag an article with a given topic so that other users are able to find that information. As part of the ongoing development,
        this process will improve, become more refined, and become a useful way to consume your news and stay informed.
